<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The vector class handles vectors in a 3D space.
It handles three coordinates, it also has a homogeneous parameter (always = 0).

An instance is constructed from two vertex orig and a dest.
It represents the vector between the two points.
new Vector(array('dest'=>[instance of vertex], 'orig'=>[instance of vertex]);
if 'orig' is not given then it will default to (0,0,0);

All attributes are private.  Once a vector is created you cannot change
it's values. Therefore only use getters.

The following methods are provided in this class:

* magnitude() : return norm of current instanced vector;

* normalize() : return the normalized vector (if it is already normalized
a fresh copy of the instance is returned);

* add(Vector $rhs) : return the sum of the current instance and $rhs.

* sub(Vector $rhs) : return the diffence of the current instance and $rhs.

* opposite() : return the opposite vector.

* scalarProduct( $k ) : return the product of the constant and the
current instance.

* dotProduct( $rhs ) : return the scalar product of $rhs and the current
instance.

* cos( $rhs ) : returns the cosine angle between $rhs and the current instance.

* crossProduct( $rhs ) : return the cross product of $rhs and the current
instance (right hand mark).
